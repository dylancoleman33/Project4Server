##Aproach Taken 

In 2017, the general population is too lazy to physically meet up with groups to discuss a specific book. So I created this application where the book club comes to you. Create an account, search an add a book, and then run wild in the comment section. 

##Installation Instructions 
Create an account using a specific username and password, then log in to activate the site. Once you are finished with your session, you are allowed to log out. Only when logged in are you allowed to save books and comment on posts. 

##User Stories 
As a user I want to create an account. As a user I want to log in to my account using a specific username and password. As a user I want to search for books and save them to my page. As a user I want to comment on other books and voice my opinion. As a user I want to be able to log out when I am finished with my session.
